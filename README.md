### `docker-service-client`
Sample of an ASP.NET Core OpenAPI service, and a .NET based GRPC service with a test client, all in Docker containers, using HTTPS. There is documentation
on how to run a service with HTTPS in Docker, but nothing on how to run a client in a container too, and be able to use HTTPS in development/debugging.
